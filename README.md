ðŸ‘¯ Hello! My name is Nantale Tracy Cynthia, and I am a computer engineering graduate from Busitema University. 
ðŸ‘¯ Currently, I am pursuing my passion for networking and cybersecurity as an intern at RENU (Research and Education Network for Uganda).
ðŸ‘¯ During my time at Busitema University, I gained a comprehensive understanding of computer engineering principles, including hardware, software, and network systems. 
ðŸ‘¯ My coursework provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages, computer architecture, and data structures.
ðŸ‘¯ Through my internship at RENU, I have the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. 
ðŸ‘¯ Working alongside experienced professionals, I believe I am going to develop skills in network administration, troubleshooting, and ensuring data security. 
ðŸ‘¯ My passion for networking and cybersecurity stems from a deep desire to contribute to creating secure and reliable communication infrastructures. 
ðŸ‘¯ I am a dedicated and proactive individual, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. 
ðŸ‘¯ Thank you for taking the time to review my profile.
